            I’m second generation in a roofing company that is over 40 years
            old. For the most part we’ve always done retail roofing, meaning we
            don’t chase storms and cover an area roughly 75 miles from our home
            base. In the last 3 years we’ve started doing insurance jobs more
            often. They probably consist of 80% of our business now. At the
            beginning we would ask for and get insurance paperwork from the
            customer. We would just roll with whatever the adjuster and the
            insurance company said. We realized quickly that the insurance
            companies do not always have the policy holders’ best interest at
            heart. We needed help with our estimates and did not want to take
            the time to purchase and learn Xactimate. We tried a few companies.
            They promised to raise our claims 30% or more and then get paid
            based on how much they raise it over what the original insurance
            adjuster had figured. This formula is a recipe for bad behavior and
            dishonesty. Make no mistake, we want to get paid for everything we
            complete on a build however, we don’t want to get paid for made up
            fees or made up tasks. Totalscope has been one of the best
            partnerships we have. I mean that word “partnership”. They help us
            get our estimates right. They include all documentation, codes etc…
            to get us paid and take care of the policy holder. Sometimes it
            takes multiple revisions as we work with adjusters to get it right
            Drew Suttle and his team are patient and help us through these
            revisions. Every dime I spend with them is well worth it. I could
            not recommend anyone more highly.
