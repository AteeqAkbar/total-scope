      <div>Why We Started TotalScope</div>
      <p>
        After running a successful roofing & restoration company for a number of
        years, we noticed that our in-house estimates far out-paced those of our
        fellow contractors. First one, then another, then more and more were
        asking us to write their estimates for them, as they were getting larger
        and larger claims easily approved. We turned this into our side hustle,
        then one day found that roofing had become the side hustle after writing
        estimates and supplements was taking most of our time. The writing was
        on the wall, so we decided to go all-in on TotalScope. We created a
        data-collection app that has taken the industry by surprise, and by
        storm. Our proprietary process in creating top-notch estimates is
        allowing us to serve you, our clients, better and better every day by
        increasing not only your bottom line but also decreasing your time spent
        on each project. So, now you can go fishing, or do another project, the
        choice is yours. Either way, we got you covered.
